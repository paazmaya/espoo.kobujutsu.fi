[![Code Smells](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=paazmaya_espoo.kobujutsu.fi&metric=code_smells)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=paazmaya_espoo.kobujutsu.fi)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b8499483-a87c-4808-a035-7e56a6f28a34/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/espoon-yuishinkai/deploys)

The web site is available at `espoo.kobujutsu.fi`, in which it is deployed immediately when something is pushed to this GitHub repository.
The web site is hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), for free since creating open source stuff is great.

The site is configured to only allow secured connections (via `https`) and
the certificates for it are provided for free by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Running locally with Netlify Dev

```sh
npm install --global netlify-cli
netlify dev
```

Now site is available at [`http://localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888).

## Service Worker

Service Worker is used for caching assets, also
[with `backgroundFetch`](https://philna.sh/blog/2017/07/04/experimenting-with-the-background-fetch-api/).
However, by default the network is used, and only when it fails, then local cache is utilised.

## Sub-resource Integrity

I just had to play with [SRI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity):

```sh
shasum -a 384 public/assets/default.css | xxd -r -p | base64
```

[It is currently supported by most popular browsers.](https://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity)

## Various image formats

In addition to the common jpeg, there are webp and avif variants available, where
supported, as determined by the `picture` element.

https://reachlightspeed.com/blog/using-the-new-high-performance-avif-image-format-on-the-web-today/

```sh
avifenc --min 32 --max 42 public/assets/ohjaaja-jukka.jpg public/assets/ohjaaja-jukka.avif
cwebp -q 75 public/assets/ohjaaja-jukka.jpg -o public/assets/ohjaaja-jukka.webp
```

## Cross browser supported styling

CSS should be passed through [online Autoprefixer at `autoprefixer.github.io`](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).
Using there the option `"last 4 version"`.

## Testing with sitespeed.io

Install [the `sitespeed.io`](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/) command line tool via [`npm`, that comes with Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

```sh
[sudo] npm install --global sitespeed.io
```

Execute:

```sh
sitespeed.io https://espoo.kobujutsu.fi
```

Results will appear in the folder `sitespeed-results/espoo.kobujutsu.fi/`.

## Testing with Webhint

Install [the `hint`](https://webhint.io) command line tool via [`npm`, that comes with Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

```sh
[sudo] npm install --global --engine-strict hint
```

The tool can be used via:

```sh
npx hint https://espoo.kobujutsu.fi
```

The report is written under `hint-report` folder. The [`npx` used in the above command](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with Node.js installation.
